# Running the Application
Make sure the Android Emulator you are running has the following hardware:

```Google Pixel 6 (8 cores)

OS: Android 11, Google API level 30

Chipset: 8-core built-in GPU

CPU: Octa-core (2x2.80 GHz Cortex-X1, 2x2.25 GHz CortexA76, 4x1.80 GHz Cortex-A55)

GPU: Mali-G78 MP20

RAM: 8GB RAM

Positioning: GPS (L1+L5), GLONASS (G1), BDS
            (B1I+B1c+B2a), GALILEO (E1+E5a), QZSS
            (L1+L5)
```

Then, assuming the project successfully builds, you can simply go to "Debug -> Start Debugging" to run the application.
